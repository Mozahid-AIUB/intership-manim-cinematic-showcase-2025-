#  PROJECT DOCUMENTION

A professional-grade animated video project built with Manim Community Edition, featuring a branded intro, dynamic team showcase, and polished outro. This project demonstrates advanced animation techniques, modular code architecture, and production-ready workflows suitable for academic presentations, professional portfolios, and collaborative team introductions.

## Features

- **Cinematic Intro (15s)**: Custom logo animation with geometric compositing, gradient effects, and smooth transitions
- **Team Showcase (3min)**: Dynamic member profiles with orbiting particles, role displays, and synchronized animations
- **Professional Outro (15s)**: Creative closure with trace effects and thematic consistency
- **Production Pipeline**: Automated rendering scripts and post-processing for seamless video compilation
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated scene components for maintainability and reusability

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Manim Community Edition (`pip install manim`)
- FFmpeg (for video encoding)
- PowerShell (recommended on Windows)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manim-cinematic-video.git
cd manim-cinematic-video
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Verify FFmpeg installation:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

## Usage

### Quick Preview Rendering
```powershell
# Render individual scenes in low quality for testing
manim -pql scenes/intro.py Intro
manim -pql scenes/main_content.py MainContent
manim -pql scenes/outro.py FinalVideo
```

### Full Production Render
```powershell
# Execute complete build pipeline
.\scripts\build.ps1
```

## Scene Details

### Intro Scene (`intro.py`)
- Animates logo with gradient flares and stroke-draw effects
- Slides in tagline text with coordinated transitions
- Uses branded color scheme (PURE_PINK = "#ff69b4", DARK_BG)
- 15-second duration with smooth fade transitions

### Main Content Scene (`main_content.py`)
- Features team member cards with polar arrangement
- Implements orbiting particle effects and glow animations
- Displays roles and fun facts with synchronized timing
- Precisely timed to fit 3-minute duration

### Outro Scene (`outro.py`)
- "Thank You" message with scaling and shimmer effects
- Branded outro animation matching intro elements
- Smooth fade-out with optional audio fade
- 15-second closure sequence

## Technical Implementation

### Advanced Animation Techniques
- **ValueTrackers & Updaters**: Real-time parameter control for dynamic animations
- **Boolean Operations**: Geometric compositing for visual effects
- **Path Tracing**: Real-time trajectory visualization for outro effects
- **Synchronized Group Animations**: Coordinated movement of multiple elements

### Code Architecture
- Modular scene classes for separation of concerns
- Reusable components (TeamCard class, effect functions)
- Configurable timing parameters for easy adjustment
- Brand consistency through centralized color definitions

## Team Contributions

| Member | Responsibilities |
|--------|------------------|
| **Rakib** | Project lead, documentation, task coordination, pipeline automation ,testing|
| **Nibir** | Intro scene development, Git Bash compatibility solutions , iddle scene animations, debugging|
| **Mozahidul** | Outro scene implementation, final video composition, audio mixing |


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Render Errors on Windows**
   - **Problem**: Missing Unix utilities in Git Bash
   - **Solution**: Use PowerShell or Command Prompt instead

2. **SVG/PNG Handling**
   - **Problem**: Incorrect object types for assets
   - **Solution**: Use `ImageMobject` for PNG/JPG, `SVGMobject` for vectors

3. **Color & Variable Errors**
   - **Problem**: Undefined color references
   - **Solution**: Define brand colors at module level

4. **Animation Synchronization**
   - **Problem**: Misaligned group movements
   - **Solution**: Use anchor-based transformation logic

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use descriptive variable names and comments
- Modularize reusable components
- Maintain consistent code style
- Implement error handling for asset loading

### Visual Design
- Maintain consistent color palette throughout
- Use harmonious transitions between scenes
- Balance visual complexity with clarity
- Test animations at various quality levels

### Performance
- Minimize unnecessary redraws
- Use updaters judiciously
- Profile resource-intensive scenes
- Optimize asset sizes and formats

## Rendering Options

### Quality Presets
```bash
# Low quality (quick testing)
manim -pql scene.py SceneName

# Medium quality (preview)
manim -pqm scene.py SceneName

# High quality (production)
manim -pqh scene.py SceneName

# 4K ultra quality
manim -pqk scene.py SceneName
```

### Custom Resolution
```bash
manim -pqh --resolution 1920,1080 scene.py SceneName
```

## Extending the Project

### Adding New Scenes
1. Create new Python file in `scenes/` directory
2. Implement class extending `Scene`
3. Add to build script if needed
4. Test with preview rendering

### Custom Assets
1. Place images in `assets/` directory
2. Use appropriate object type (ImageMobject/SVGMobject)
3. Reference with relative paths

### Modifying Styles
- Update color definitions in individual scenes
- Adjust timing parameters as needed
- Modify animation sequences while maintaining structure
